## TODO

- Periodically compact index
- Periodically compact data file
- Buffered writes
- Don't keep checking the current position when reading index changes from file 
- Reuse encoder and decoder instances
- Cache the key -> encoded key mapping in memory for key-value store
- Use the key hash in key-value store index
- Don't keep entire index in memory
- Tests verify file contents
- Test app dumps store contents
  - Value size
- Protect from partially written index file
- Test app benchmarks read and write - one value, many values, multiple threads
- Multi-thread safety: threads that read/write separate values, threads read/write same values
  - Prevent concurrent updates of index
- Multi-process safety
  - Write lock the files
- Basic garbage collection
- Atomic update
- Concurrent reads
- Optimistic concurrent updates
- Encoding uses type tags?
- Encoding uses variable length encoding for string length
- Use a more compact encoding than JSON, and stream to file rather than collecting in a string
- Async write to file
- Option for storing secrets, eg set permissions, encode
- Optionally discard on incompatible version
