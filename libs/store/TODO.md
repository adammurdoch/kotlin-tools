## TODO

- Buffered writes
- Tests verify file contents
- Test app dumps store contents
  - Value size
- Keep data and index files open (e.g. use IO threads?)
- Separate reader and writer `FileContent` to avoid seek when writing
- Write a header for data blocks?
- Stream deltas to index and periodically compact
- Protect from partially written index file
- Test app benchmarks read and write - one value, many values, multiple threads
- Native test app
- Store key-value pairs
- Multi-thread safety: threads that read/write separate values, threads read/write same values
  - Prevent concurrent updates of index
- Multi-process safety
  - Write lock the files
- Basic garbage collection
- Version the store format
  - Version the data file 
  - Include the encoding version in store metadata
- Atomic update
- Concurrent reads
- Optimistic concurrent updates
- Encoding uses type tags?
- Encoding uses variable length encoding for string length
- Use a more compact encoding than JSON, and stream to file rather than collecting in a string
- Async write to file
- Option for storing secrets, eg set permissions, encode
- Optionally discard on incompatible version
